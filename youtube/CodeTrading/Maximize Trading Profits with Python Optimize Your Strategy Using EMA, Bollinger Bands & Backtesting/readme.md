## Signal for the strategy

1. __Exponencial moving everage (EMA)__:
    1. Exponential moving averages (EMAs) are designed to see price trends over specific time frames, such as 50 or 200 days.
    1. Compared to simple moving averages, EMAs give greater weight to recent (more relevant) data.
    1. Computing the EMA involves applying a multiplier to the simple moving average (SMA).
    1. Moving average ribbons allow traders to see multiple EMAs at the same time.

    __Limitations of the EMA.__

1. __Relative Strength Index (RSI)__: This is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to evaluate overvalued or undervalued conditions in the price of that security. The rules of RSI is follwing:
    1.  The RSI provides technical traders with signals about bullish and bearish price momentum, and it is often plotted beneath the graph of an asset’s price.
    1. An asset is usually considered overbought when the RSI is above 70 and oversold when it is below 30.
    1. The RSI line crossing below the overbought line or above oversold line is often seen by traders as a signal to buy or sell.
    1. The RSI works best in trading ranges rather than trending markets.

    __Limitations of the RSI.__

1. __Average true range (ATR)__: This is an indicator of the price volatility of an asset. It is best used to determine how much an investment's price has been moving in the period being evaluated rather than an indication of a trend. Calculating an investment's ATR is relatively straightforward, only requiring you to use price data for the period you're investigating. The rules of RSI is follwing:
    1. The average true range (ATR) is a market volatility indicator used in technical analysis.
    1. It is typically derived from the 14-day simple moving average of a series of true range indicators.
    1. The ATR was initially developed for use in commodities markets but has since been applied to all types of securities.
    1. ATR shows investors the average range prices swing for an investment over a specified period.

    __Limitations of the ATR.__
    1. ATR is a subjective measure, meaning that it is open to interpretation. No single ATR value will tell you with any certainty that a trend is about to reverse or not. Instead, ATR readings should always be compared against earlier readings to get a feel of a trend's strength or weakness.  
    1. ATR only measures volatility and not the direction of an asset's price. This can sometimes result in mixed signals, particularly when markets are experiencing pivots or when trends are at turning points. For instance, a sudden increase in the ATR following a large move counter to the prevailing trend may lead some traders to think the ATR is confirming the old trend; however, this may not be the case.
