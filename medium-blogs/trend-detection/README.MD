# Understanding F1-Score
The F1-Score is a metric commonly used in classification problems to assess a modelâ€™s accuracy by considering both precision and recall. It balances precision (the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives) and recall (the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives).

### The formula for F1-Score is as follows:

```
F1-Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
```

The F1-Score ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible score, indicating perfect precision and recall. A higher F1-Score implies a better-performing model in terms of correctly identifying positive instances (trends) while minimizing false positives and false negatives.
